# Taxi-Fare-Prediction
The objective of my project is to create a model that can accurately estimate the fair for a taxi ride in New York City based on the input features.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 'num_of_passengers': How many passengers were in the taxi?
💵 'fare': What's the base fare for the journey?[In INR]

🎀 'miscellaneous_fees': Were there any additional charges during the trip?e.g. tolls, convenience fees, GST
etc.[In INR]
💰 'total_fare': The grand total for the ride (this is your prediction target!).[In INR]
